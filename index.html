    <h1>Sukie Wilson</h1>
    <p>Sukie Wilson is a London-based writer, working around the slowed-time of chronic illness. Their work has been shortlisted for Spread The Word’s Early Career Bursary and the Alpine Fellowship prize, as well as being longlisted for New Writing North’s A Writing Chance. They are a multi-tasker by nature, so Sukie is currently working on both a collection of short stories and their first novel.</p>
