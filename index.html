    <h1>Sukie Wilson</h1>
    <p>
        Sukie Wilson is a London-based writer, working around the
        slowed-time of chronic illness. Their work has been shortlisted for
        Spread The Word’s Early Career Bursary and the Alpine Fellowship
        prize, as well as being longlisted for New Writing North’s A Writing
        Chance. They are a multi-tasker by nature, so Sukie is currently
        working on both a collection of short stories and their first novel.
